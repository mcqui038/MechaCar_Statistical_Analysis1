### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Ground Clearance is the only variable that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the line is not zero because the r-squared value is greater than zero. This model does not predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes well because only one of the variables was significant. 

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The manufacturing lots in total meet the requirements for the variance of suspension coils as the variance is under 100 PSI. Based on idividual lots, only lot 1 and lot 2 meet the requirements for variance of suspension coils. Lot 3 exceeds the 100 PSI threshold for coil variance.
